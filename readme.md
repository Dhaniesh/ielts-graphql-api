# GraphQL Article Carousel Demo

This mock project demonstrates how GraphQL can be used as a more efficient and flexible alternative to traditional REST APIs. It showcases the performance benefits of GraphQL by allowing clients to fetch only the data they needâ€”improving response time, reducing payload size, and increasing maintainability.

## âœ¨ Purpose

To advocate for and demonstrate the advantages of GraphQL to stakeholders within the organization. The key use case is an article carousel UI component that only needs a subset of article data: `title`, `urlSlug`, `imageUrl`, and a short summary.

## ðŸš€ Technologies

- Node.js
- Apollo Server (GraphQL)
- Express
- JavaScript

## ðŸ§  Key Concepts Demonstrated

- **Selective Data Fetching:** Fetch only required fields (e.g., `title`, `slug`, `image`, `summary`) instead of full payloads.
- **Nested Types:** Example of how GraphQL handles nested data structures (e.g., `description.shortDescription`).
- **Query Efficiency:** Comparison with REST APIs showing significant reduction in JSON response size.
- **Scalability:** Flexible schema design supporting future extension without breaking existing clients.

- Graphql response (13.1KB):
